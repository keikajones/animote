# Animote

http://animote.herokuapp.com/

### Description
Animote was inspired by the idea of creating a site that can either enhance the current mood your are in or counter your current mood. Ken, Jason and I wanted to create fun, easy-to-use site where people can go to unwind, cry, vent or laugh. And each time you visit the site will be a brand new experience.
